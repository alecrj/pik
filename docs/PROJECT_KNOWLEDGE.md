# 📚 Pikaso Project Documentation - Phase 2 Ready

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: FOUNDATION COMPLETE**

### **✅ What's Working**
- **Zero TypeScript errors** - Clean, production-ready codebase
- **Proper routing** - Expo-router integration functional
- **Context providers** - State management operational
- **Engine architecture** - Scalable modular system ready for features
- **Basic drawing canvas** - Functional but needs professional upgrade
- **Tab navigation** - All screens accessible

### **⚠️ What Needs Immediate Attention**
- **Missing onboarding route** - Route exists but no screen file
- **Basic drawing experience** - Current canvas is placeholder-level
- **No real Apple Pencil support** - Just basic touch events
- **Minimal learning content** - Need professional lesson system
- **Missing social features** - Community tab is placeholder

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE FIX: Missing Onboarding Route**

### **Quick Fix**
Create `app/onboarding.tsx` with the **"Professional Onboarding Screen"** artifact above.

**Why it's missing**: Route is registered in `_layout.tsx` but no actual screen file exists.
