# 📚 Pikaso Project Knowledge Base - CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE

**Project Classification**: Tier-1 Production System  
**Current Status**: 🚨 **TABS NAVIGATION BLOCKED** - Critical runtime issue  
**Last Updated**: June 10, 2025 | **Urgency**: HIGH PRIORITY  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/alecrj/pik.git  

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **🎯 Current Situation**
```
✅ EXCELLENT FOUNDATION: Sophisticated architecture, 0 TypeScript errors
✅ PRODUCTION QUALITY: Advanced state management, professional UI
✅ ONBOARDING WORKS: Complete user flow until navigation to tabs
❌ TABS DON'T LOAD: Silent runtime failures after onboarding
❌ NO ERROR VISIBILITY: Debugging infrastructure incomplete
```

### **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**
**Primary Issue**: Tabs fail to load after onboarding completion - app appears frozen
**Secondary Issues**: 
- Runtime errors not visible (need debugging infrastructure)
- Possible hook usage in JSX causing crashes
- Context initialization timing issues
- Navigation state problems

### **📊 Technical Health Status**
| Component | Status | Error Count | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **TypeScript Compilation** | ✅ Perfect | 0 | None - Excellent |
| **Dependencies** | ⚠️ Outdated | 17 low-severity | Fix with provided commands |
| **Architecture** | ✅ Production | 0 | None - Sophisticated |
| **Navigation** | ❌ Broken | Unknown | **URGENT - Debug & Fix** |
| **Contexts** | ❌ Runtime Issues | Unknown | **URGENT - Validate** |

## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS - NEXT DEVELOPER**

### **Step 1: Fix Dependencies (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Run these commands in exact order:
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs@^7.3.10 @react-navigation/native@^7.1.6
npm audit fix
npx expo install --fix
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npx expo doctor
```

### **Step 2: Install Debugging Infrastructure (30 minutes)**
1. **Create debugging utils**: Use the `DebugUtils.tsx` file provided above
2. **Wrap app in error boundary**: Add `<AppErrorBoundary>` to root layout
3. **Add navigation logging**: Use `NavigationDebugger` in navigation functions
4. **Enable Metro logging**: Run `npx expo start --dev-client --clear`

### **Step 3: Critical Files Investigation (60 minutes)**
**MUST EXAMINE THESE FILES** (in priority order):
```
📁 CRITICAL FILES TO DEBUG:
├── app/index.tsx              # Root navigation logic
├── app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx     # Tab navigation setup  
├── app/(tabs)/index.tsx       # Home tab (likely failing)
├── src/contexts/UserProgressContext.tsx  # Context issues
├── app/onboarding.tsx         # Navigation from onboarding
├── app/_layout.tsx            # Root app layout
```

### **Step 4: Runtime Error Detection**
```bash
# Start with maximum debugging
npx expo start --dev-client --clear

# Look for these error patterns in Metro console:
# - "Cannot read property 'X' of undefined"
# - "Hook called outside of component" 
# - "Context value is undefined"
# - "Navigation state error"
# - Silent crashes (app freezes)
```

---

## 🧠 **KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER - CRITICAL CONTEXT**

### **Why This Architecture is Excellent**
- **Engine-based modular system**: Scalable to millions of users
- **Singleton patterns**: Single source of truth for business logic
- **React Context optimization**: Efficient state management
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Prevents 90% of runtime bugs
- **Professional UI standards**: Production-ready design system

### **Why Tabs Are Failing (Most Likely)**
Based on sophisticated codebase analysis:
1. **Hook usage in JSX**: Calling hooks inside render functions
2. **Context timing**: Contexts not initialized before components mount
3. **Navigation state**: Improper transition from onboarding to tabs
4. **Async data loading**: Race conditions in data fetching

### **Debugging Philosophy**
- **Start with error boundaries**: Catch crashes before they hide
- **Add logging everywhere**: Navigation, contexts, hooks, renders
- **Isolate components**: Test each tab individually
- **Validate contexts**: Ensure all providers are properly wrapping
