## 🚨 **CURRENT TECHNICAL DEBT - IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED**

### **Critical Errors to Resolve (Next Session)**

```typescript
// 1. Missing TabBarIcon import in _layout.tsx

// 2. Wrong import in challenges.tsx
import { Flame } from 'lucide-react-native'; // Change Fire to Flame

// 3. Type mismatch in portfolioManager
getArtwork(artworkId: string): Artwork | null // Fix parameter type

// 4. ScrollView onRefresh prop issue
// Use RefreshControl component instead

// 5. PerformanceMonitor missing startSession

  startSession(): void { /* implement */ }
}

// 6. SkillLevel type casting in onboarding
skillLevel: selectedSkillLevel as SkillLevel,

// 7. Slider import for settings
import Slider from '@react-native-slider/slider';

// 8. Theme name property access
value: theme.isDark, // Instead of theme.name === 'dark'

// 9. Context method return types
startLesson: (lesson: Lesson) => Promise<void>; // Fix return type
completeLesson: (score?: number) => Promise<void>; // Fix return type

// 10. DataManager export
