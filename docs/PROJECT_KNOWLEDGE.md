Phase 2: Engine-level fixes (business logic layer)
Phase 3: Context integration (state management layer)
Phase 4: UI component fixes (presentation layer)
Result: 83 → 0 errors in single focused session
Key: Bottom-up approach with complete type definitions first
```

#### **Performance Architecture Secrets**
```
React Native Optimization:
  - React.memo for expensive components ✅
  - Efficient state updates with contexts ✅
  - Lazy loading with performance monitoring ✅
  - Memory management with cleanup ✅

Drawing Performance:

  - Optimistic updates for UX ✅
```

### **🚨 Critical Knowledge - Institutional Memory**

#### **TypeScript Error Resolution Patterns**
```
Pattern 1: Interface Completeness
  Problem:     Missing properties in type definitions
  Solution:    Comprehensive interface auditing with backward compatibility
  Prevention:  Strict compilation gates with complete type coverage

Pattern 2: Null Safety Implementation  
  Problem:     Possible undefined values in business logic
  Solution:    Defensive programming with fallback values
  Prevention:  Strict null checks with comprehensive validation

Pattern 3: Context Integration
  Problem:     Type mismatches between engines and UI contexts
  Solution:    Clear adapter patterns with type transformation
  Prevention:  Interface-driven development with contract testing
```

#### **Architecture Decision Framework**
```
Technical Decisions:
  - Always choose type safety over development speed
  - Prefer composition over inheritance for scalability
  - Implement error boundaries at every layer
  - Design for 10x current requirements from day one

Performance Decisions:
  - 60fps drawing is non-negotiable requirement
  - Memory usage must scale linearly with content
  - Network requests must be optimized for mobile
  - Battery usage optimized for extended sessions

Business Logic:
  - Psychology-driven engagement patterns
  - Scalable content management systems
  - Data-driven optimization opportunities
  - Community features for retention
